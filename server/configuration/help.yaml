    description: |
      Create a custom prompt
      Example: "settings prompt [#HP#/#HPMAX#]"
      This will make your prompt look like "[100/100]"

      Here are all possible values for prompts:
      #HP#          - Health 
      #MP#          - Magicka 
      #PHYARM#      - Physical Armor 
      #MAGARM#      - Magical Armor
      #HPMAX#       - Maximum Health 
      #MPMAX#       - Maximum Magicka 
      #PHYARMMAX#   - Maximum Physical Armor 
      #MAGARMMAX#   - Maximum Magical Armor
      #HP%#         - Health percentage
      #MP%#         - Magicka percentage
      #PHYARM%#     - Physical Armor percentage
      #MAGARM%#     - Magical Armor percentage
      #THREAT#      - Current Threat 
      #GRIT#        - Value of GRIT
      #FLOW#        - Value of FLOW
      #MIND#        - Value of MIND
      #SOUL#        - Value of SOUL
      #LVL#         - Current Level

      You can also add "L" right after the first # to adjust the value to the left.
      Like so "LHP" or #LMAGARM%#

      * By default the values all have a set width of 3, if the value is less than 3 characters
        for example "10" "99" or "1", the value will be displayed like so "  1".
        "L" will make it adjust to the left and display like so "1  ".

      * Percentages will not append the "%", meaning "#HP%#" will display "100" not "100%"
        To customize this, you can simple add another "%" character after the last #
        Example: "#HP%#%" will now display "100%"

      * You can use colors in your prompts, to do this you need to add a color_code.
        Color codes will not work if they are inside two "#"
        Example: "@.red#HP#" NOT "#@.redHP#"

        If you wish to use colors, read more about them with help color

      There are some premade prompts, that can be selected with:
      settings prompt <0-5>

      settings prompt 0 is the default prompt
      
      Lastly: here is an example of a prompt:
      "---@.bred#HP#@.normal/@.bred#LHPMAX#@.normal HP--->"

      - go <exit>
    description: |
      You can move from room to room via exits.
      You use the go command and specify an exit like so: "go west".
      
      Directions like NORTH EAST SOUTH WEST UP and DOWN will work 
      without the "go" command.

      Likewise N E S W U and D will also function as valid exits if present.

      Colors can be used to enhance the "say" command.
      Or can be used to customize your prompt with "set prompt"

      To use a color, you need to prefix it with a "@" like "@.red" 
      (remove the ".") inbetween

      example: "say @.bgyellowHELLO@.normal" -> "say @bgyellowHELLO@normal"
