    description: |
      Create a custom prompt
      Example: "settings prompt [#HP#/#HPMAX#]"
      This will make your prompt look like "[100/100]"

      Here are all possible values for prompts:
      #HP#          - Health 
      #MP#          - Magicka 
      #PHYARM#      - Physical Armor 
      #MAGARM#      - Magical Armor
      #HPMAX#       - Maximum Health 
      #MPMAX#       - Maximum Magicka 
      #PHYARMMAX#   - Maximum Physical Armor 
      #MAGARMMAX#   - Maximum Magical Armor
      #HP%#         - Health percentage
      #MP%#         - Magicka percentage
      #PHYARM%#     - Physical Armor percentage
      #MAGARM%#     - Magical Armor percentage
      #THREAT#      - Current Threat 
      #GRIT#        - Value of GRIT
      #FLOW#        - Value of FLOW
      #MIND#        - Value of MIND
      #SOUL#        - Value of SOUL
      #LVL#         - Current Level

      You can also add "L" right after the first # to adjust the value to the left.
      Like so "LHP" or #LMAGARM%#

      * By default the values all have a set width of 3, if the value is less than 3 characters
        for example "10" "99" or "1", the value will be displayed like so "  1".
        "L" will make it adjust to the left and display like so "1  ".

      * Percentages will not append the "%", meaning "#HP%#" will display "100" not "100%"
        To customize this, you can simple add another "%" character after the last #
        Example: "#HP%#%" will now display "100%"

      * You can use colors in your prompts, to do this you need to add a color_code.
        Color codes will not work if they are inside two "#"
        Example: "@.red#HP#" NOT "#@.redHP#"

        If you wish to use colors, read more about them with help color

      There are some premade prompts, that can be selected with:
      settings prompt <0-5>

      settings prompt 0 is the default prompt

      indexes, or indexing, is a way of specifying which character or item you are targetting.
      if you have more than one Handaxe in your inventory, it could be difficult to specify which 
      one you want to look at.

      You can use indexes by specifying a number. For example;
      'look 2.handaxe' will display the second handaxe in your inventory
      'look -1.handaxe' will display the last handaxe available.
